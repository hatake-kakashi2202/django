    <p>this is just a sample copy of my project for iota,it will not be published.</p>
    <p>the matter in this website which i intended to write and the matter in the navigation bar is all taken from the book hacking: be a hacker with ethics written by harsh bothra.<p>
    <p>this website was coded using concepts of HTML and CSS taught to us by iota club and some extra reference from the website w3schools.com<p>
    <p> i would like to thank them for the knowledge that i gained<p>
